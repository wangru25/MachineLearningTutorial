# MachineLearningTutorial
A machine learning tutorial for graduate students who enrolled in MTH994. This course aims to provide you a better understanding of machine learning algorithms. Therefore, we encourage students to code without unsing any machine learning libraries such as Pytorch or Tensorflow.
